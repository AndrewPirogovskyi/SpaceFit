                <h2>How To Do Each Abs Workout</h2>
                <p>
                    Each of these abs workouts is a mini-circuit you can do at the end of your main workout. The circuits are designed to work the maximum number of muscle fibres as quickly and effectively as possible, so you'll do all moves in order, sticking to the reps and rest periods detailed. The first move of each circuit is the hardest, then they get progressively easier as the number of reps per move increases. This works your abs harder and places them under greater tension for longer, which is ultimately what stimulates muscle growth. After the final move, rest for the allotted time, then repeat the circuit. Do three circuits in total.
                </p>
                <h2>What's the frequency?</h2>
                <p>
                    Once upon a time, the myth was that, as "endurance" muscles, the abs should be trained every day. Now it's more common to encounter claims that you only need one dedicated core workout a week – but the truth lies somewhere in between. "Two or three abs workouts a week might be optimal for most people," says trainer Jonny Jacobs. "Breaking it up into separate days – for static, anti-rotation work and dynamic movements – is one good option."

                <h2>Remember!</h2>
                <p>
                    Having a strong core can help you with almost any sport or physical activity, but your abs are only part of your core. The core also includes your obliques (the muscles at the sides of your abdomen) as well as other muscles in your back and even your glutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not only can working out abs every day lead to postural problems, but also muscle imbalances. Your abs complex, which is all your abs muscles are comprised of the rectus abdominus, transverse abdominus, internal obliques, and external obliques. If you do standard crunches 7 days a week for 300 reps, your rectus abdominus muscle (the six-pack muscle) is likely to get trained much more intensely than the other abs muscles. Doing a bunch of crunches does not necessarily translate into strong abs, or a stable core.
                    Even worse, if you do get your rectus abdominus too strong relative to your other abs and lower back muscles, you may be more susceptible to injury.
                    <b>While having nice abs is like the international sign of fitness, there are much more effective ways to work out your abs than to do a bunch of crunches every day! So try to avoid overtraining and do everything wisely!</b>
