                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>Nutrition is an important part of sport performance for young athletes, in addition to allowing for optimal growth and development. Macronutrients, micronutrients and fluids in the proper amounts are essential to provide energy for growth and activity. To optimize performance, young athletes need to learn what, when and how to eat and drink before, during and after activity.</p>

                    <center><p><h2>Meal Planning</h2></p></center>
                    One of the trickiest things to manage is meal planning around athletic events. The timing of meals is very important and needs to be individualized. 
                    It is important for athletes to discover which foods they like that also help to maximize performance. They should not experiment with new foods or new routines on the day of competition.
                    General guidelines include eating meals a minimum of 3 h before an event to allow for proper digestion and to minimize incidence of gastrointestinal upset during exercise. 
                    Meals should include carbohydrates, protein and fat. Fibre should be limited. High-fat meals should be avoided before exercise because they can delay gastric-emptying, make athletes feel sluggish and thereby adversely affect performance. 
                    For early morning practices or events, having a snack or liquid meal 1 h to 2 h before exercise, followed by a full breakfast after the event, will help ensure sufficient energy to maximize performance.
                    Pre-game snacks or liquid meals should be ingested 1 h to 2 h before an event to allow for digestion before start of exercise. Snacks can include fresh fruit, dried fruit, a bowl of cereal with milk, juice or fruit-based smoothies. 
                    During an event, sports drinks, fruit or granola bars can be ingested to help refuel and keep energy levels high.

                    <p><h2>Water: How much should you drink every day?</h2></p>
                    <p>It's a simple question with no easy answer. Studies have produced varying recommendations over the years. 
                    But your individual water needs depend on many factors, including your health, how active you are and where you live.
                    So, here you can see the table of norms water per a day:

                        <h2>Should know!</h2>
                    </p>
                    <p>Whether you're a serious athlete or simply exercise for recreation, it's important to stay hydrated. 
                    Good hydration means getting the right amount of water before, during, and after exercise. 
                    Water regulates your body temperature and lubricates your joints. It helps transport nutrients to give you energy and keep you healthy. 
                    If you're not hydrated, your body can't perform at its highest level. You may feel tired, have muscle cramps, dizziness, or other serious symptoms.
                    </p>
                    <center><p><h2>Reaching the finish line</h2></p></center>
                    A well-balanced diet is essential for growing athletes to maintain proper growth and optimize performance in athletic endeavours. 
                    An ideal diet comprises 45% to 65% carbohydrates, 10% to 30% protein and 25% to 35% fat. Fluids are very important for maintaining hydration and should be consumed before, during and after athletic events to prevent dehydration. 
                    Timing of food consumption is important to optimize performance. Meals should be eaten a minimum of 3 h before exercise and snacks should be eaten 1 h to 2 h before activity. Recovery foods should be consumed within 30 min of exercise and again within 1 h to 2 h of activity to allow muscles to rebuild and ensure proper recovery.

                    <p><h2>Things to consider</h2></p>
                    Athletes require a lot of energy and nutrients to stay in shape. Because of this, strict diet plans can hurt your ability and be harmful to your health. Without the calories from carbs, fat, and protein, you may not have enough strength. Not eating enough also can lead to malnutrition. Female athletes can have abnormal menstrual cycles. You increase your risk of osteoporosis, a fragile bone condition caused in part from a lack of calcium. (These potential risks are worse in adolescence but still present for adults.) Get medical help if you and your coach think you need to lose weight. Be sure to talk to your doctor before making major nutrition changes.
                    People often overestimate the amount of calories they burn when training. Avoid taking in more energy than you expend exercising. Also, avoid exercising on an empty stomach. Every athlete is different, so consider:
                    <ul>
                        <li>How long before working out is best for you to eat.</li>
                        <li>How much food is the right amount for you.</li>
                    </ul>    
                    If you need to gain or lose weight to improve performance, it must be done safely. If not, it may do more harm than good. Do not keep your body weight too low, lose weight too quickly, or prevent weight gain in unhealthy ways. It can have negative health effects.
                    Work with a registered dietitian and donâ€™t experiment with diets on your own. This can lead to poor eating habits with inadequate or excessive intake of certain nutrients.
                    Talk to your family doctor find a diet that is right for your sport, age, gender, and amount of training.
