                <p>Whether you're a serious athlete or simply exercise for recreation, it's important to stay hydrated. 
                    <br>Good hydration means getting the right amount of water before, during, and after exercise. 
                    <br>Water regulates your body temperature and lubricates your joints. It helps transport nutrients to give you energy and keep you healthy. 
                    <br>If you're not hydrated, your body can't perform at its highest level. You may feel tired, have muscle cramps, dizziness, or other serious symptoms.
