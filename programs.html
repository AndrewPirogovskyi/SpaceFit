                            When it comes to achieving your best physique, a proper strength training program is essential.
                            Whether you’re looking to transform your body or just kick your training up a notch, it’s important to add training volume (in the form of reps, sets, and weight) to stimulate new muscle growth as you progress.
                            In general, most beginners have been lifting for less than a year, intermediates for at least 1 year, and advanced trainees for at least 2 years. Keep in mind that you should not attempt advanced workouts unless you have appropriate strength training experience.
                            This article reviews several high quality training programs for men of all experience levels to maximize muscle and strength gains while ensuring adequate recovery.

                        <p>
                            These programs aren't just for the true beginner who has never touched a weight before; it’s also suitable for anyone who has taken an extended leave of absence from training. How long has it been since you went to the gym regularly? Six months? A year? Five years? No worries: The following routines will get you back on track.
                            Also many of these training programs can suit most of the athletes who do sport for 3-4 years and more. <b>But remember, if you are the professional sportsman current articles may not be right for you, so you should train only with professional coach(s) that can make special workout programs and nutrition based on your differences and abilities.</b>
