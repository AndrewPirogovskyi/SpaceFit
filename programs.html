                    When it comes to achieving your best physique, a proper strength training program is essential.
                    Whether you’re looking to transform your body or just kick your training up a notch, it’s important to add training volume (in the form of reps, sets, and weight) to stimulate new muscle growth as you progress.
                    In general, most beginners have been lifting for less than a year, intermediates for at least 1 year, and advanced trainees for at least 2 years. Keep in mind that you should not attempt advanced workouts unless you have appropriate strength training experience.
                    This article reviews several high quality training programs for men of all experience levels to maximize muscle and strength gains while ensuring adequate recovery.

                <h2>How To Do Each Abs Workout</h2>
                <p>
                Each of these abs workouts is a mini-circuit you can do at the end of your main workout. The circuits are designed to work the maximum number of muscle fibres as quickly and effectively as possible,
                so you'll do all moves in order, sticking to the reps and rest periods detailed. The first move of each circuit is the hardest, then they get progressively easier as the number of reps per move increases.
                This works your abs harder and places them under greater tension for longer, which is ultimately what stimulates muscle growth. After the final move, rest for the allotted time, then repeat the circuit. Do three circuits in total.

                <p><h2>What's the frequency?</h2>
                <br>Once upon a time, the myth was that, as "endurance" muscles, the abs should be trained every day.
                <br>Now it's more common to encounter claims that you only need one dedicated core workout a
                <br>week – but the truth lies somewhere in between. "Two or three abs workouts a week might be
                <br>optimal for most people," says trainer Jonny Jacobs. "Breaking it up into separate days – for static,
                <br>anti-rotation work and dynamic movements – is one good option."
                <h2 align = "center">Remember!</h2>
                    <p>Having a strong core can help you with almost any sport or physical activity, but your abs are only part of your core. 
                    <br>The core also includes your obliques (the muscles at the sides of your abdomen) as well as other muscles in your back and even your glutes.</p>

                <h2>In a word about chest workout...</h2>
                <p>
                    The most important rule to having a fully developed chest is that you must work the upper chest just as much as your lower chest.
                    Since your upper chest muscles are the most stubborn for growth, they will need just as much attention.
                    Not to mention, if your bench press has been plateaued for a while, hitting your upper chest hard may be exactly what you need to break through it.
                    Most people focus 90-95% of their chest workout on the lower-mid pectoral muscle development without even knowing it. It should actually be closer to 50-50.
                    The best chest workouts will grow the upper and lower sections equally.

                <br> It is recommended to do this chest workout no more than 2-3 times a week. It is very important to understand that any muscle needs rest,
                <br>otherwise you may get injured or overtrained.
