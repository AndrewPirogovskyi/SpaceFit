                <h2>In a Word About Chest Workout...</h2>
                <p>
                    The most important rule to having a fully developed chest is that you must work the upper chest just as much as your lower chest.
                    Since your upper chest muscles are the most stubborn for growth, they will need just as much attention.
                    Not to mention, if your bench press has been plateaued for a while, hitting your upper chest hard may be exactly what you need to break through it.
                    Most people focus 90-95% of their chest workout on the lower-mid pectoral muscle development without even knowing it. It should actually be closer to 50-50.
                    The best chest workouts will grow the upper and lower sections equally.
                </p>
                <h2>What's the Frequency?</h2>
                <p>
                    It is recommended to do this chest workout no more than 2-3 times a week. It is very important to understand that any muscle needs rest,
                    otherwise you may get injured or overtrained.

                <h2>More Tips for Chest Training</h2>
                <p><b>1. Always Use Controlled Movement</b></p>
                <p>
                    Whether you’re doing a barbell bench press, a dumbbell press or a cable crossover, you should always move with control. 
                    Each of these exercises has a different technique, which means you need to adjust your positioning and technique, but the principle of using control is key. This way you will be sure you are using the correct technique for the exercise and, importantly, making sure you are targeting the right muscles.
                </p>
                <p><b>2. Feel the Target Muscle</b></p>
                <p>
                    This goes hand in hand with the first point. You’d be surprised how easily a chest exercise can become a back or arm exercise with poor technique. Think about what you are trying to achieve with the movement. 
                    Bench press should, of course, be working your chest, not your shoulders or your arms, so if you feel the movement more in your front delts than your chest, adjust your position or the weight until your technique is doing what it’s meant to.
                </p>
                <p><b>3. Only Use a Weight You Can Handle</b></p>
                <p>
                    Building on the first two points, choosing the right weight and building from there is very important. Don’t let your ego lift for you. You have to train smart before you can train hard.
                    Yes, it’s true that your pec muscles respond better to heavier loads but if you get injured, you risk setting back all your progress.
                </p>
                <p><b>4. Position Your Shoulders Correctly</b></p>
                <p>
                    It’s all about scapular retraction. That means pulling your shoulders down into the bench to create tension across your whole torso.
                    In addition, your shoulders should be in line with your elbows. This is how the pec muscles will best activate. Stay aware of what your collarbone is doing as well, making sure it is moving naturally. 
                    You can even use back arch — a powerlifting technique — as long as your shoulder blades are making contact with and therefore supported by the bench. If you can get this right, you’ll feel a difference in how your chest is activating.
